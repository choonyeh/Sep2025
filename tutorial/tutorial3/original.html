<p align=justify>
A <font size=4><i><b>shepherd</b></i></font> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
</p>

<p align=justify>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn’t find any wolf. 
</p>

<p align=justify>
The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here".  <font size=4><i><b>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</b></i></font>
</p>

<p align=justify>
After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!"</strike>
</p>

<p align=justify>
<font size=4 color=purple>The farmers <sup>thought</sup> the boy was playing <sub>mischief</sub> again.</font> So, no one paid attention to him and didn’t come to his help.
